      <h2>What's going on here?</h2>
      <p>
	Imagine the effect of pointing a camera at its own
	display. The image on the display screen goes back into the
	camera, undergoes effects of being captured the camera --
	including time delay -- and is drawn back out to the
	display. This process continues rapidly and endlessly, with
	the image getting smaller and more distorted at each
	step. Emergent, fractal behavior occurs near the center of the
	display as the loops reacts to itself.
      </p>
      <p>
	This applet simulates that effect by feeding the display image
	back into itself each time it is drawn to the screen. Watch
	the movements of your mouse cursor spiral towards the center
	of the image mimicking your movements.
